# Anagram App
This project is a web application that allows you to check weather two strings are anagrams. It is built using React, Bootstrap, and hosted using Netlify. It is set up with continuous deployment. Anytime a change is made to this github repository, a new build is created and automatically deployed. 

The URL is: [http://anagram.netlify.com/](http://anagram.netlify.com/)
## Usage
The anagram checker ignores case and whitespace. It does not consider two empty strings to be anagrams.
## Code
The mojority of the relevant code is in InputForm.js and App.js. I also added a few custom styles in index.css.
